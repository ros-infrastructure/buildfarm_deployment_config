# SSH keys to be added to each host.
# The jenkins-agent public key is one you'll want to generate specifically for your deployment.
# An example:
#    $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "jenkins-agent@my-buildfarm" -f buildfarm_deployment_rsa
# Then copy the type and key in buildfarm_deployment_rsa.pub into the jenkins-agent@my-buildfarm key field below.
# The user field should remain jenkins-agent so it can be used to authenticate with the jenkins-agent user on the repo host.
#
# The contents of the private key in the example above buildfarm_deployment_rsa
# should be copied to the `jenkins::private_ssh_key` field of hiera/hieradata/buildfarm_role/master.yaml
# where it will be added via ssh-agent to running jenkins jobs on all agents.

  # Using the `buildfarm_deployment_rsa.pub` in the above example
  # you'll split the file contentsinto three different components separated by spaces:
  # * type: always ssh-rsa for rsa keys but different for other key types.
  # * public key value: The verbatim text of your public key base64-encoded.
  #   Depending on the key length this may be very long and include one or two trailing `=` of padding.
  # * comment: a plaintext "comment" which is generally used as a label identifying the key.
  # For example consider the key below:
  #     ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAAAgQCuIjV8RI7QOay95BAOuv9NlaKlm0xMfD9Q12ynKPElW+1cYhOmdmqrRqavbYxD9v2wB4hRl7VDsJak0w21UakyfKAZjhhmiMUA1yaQtJCKvw5RFbM6O/QmPNAnQDaVR2X1tRW5DVvbO2Z7ppQIHD3Ln3t5yYI/fwOgfBIsgr09Pw== jenkins-agent@my-buildfarm
