# SSH keys to be added to each host.
# The jenkins-agent public key is one you'll want to generate specifically for your deployment.
# An example:
#    $ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "jenkins-agent@my-buildfarm" -f buildfarm_deployment_key
# Then copy the type and key in buildfarm_deployment_key.pub into the jenkins-agent@my-buildfarm key field below.
# The user field should remain jenkins-agent so it can be used to authenticate with the jenkins-agent user on the repo host.
#
# The contents of the private key in the example above buildfarm_deployment_key
# should be copied to the `jenkins::private_ssh_key` field of hiera/hieradata/buildfarm_role/master.yaml
# where it will be added via ssh-agent to running jenkins jobs on all agents.
